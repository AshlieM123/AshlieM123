# Hello â€¢ Hello ðŸ‘‹

*Thanks for visiting!*

A little bit about me:
- I'm a cat person with a big heart and caring personality
- I'm new at all of this and getting more comfortable each day
- I have a prior Bachelor Degree in Graphic Design, but I'm here at ASU to advance/refresh that degree
- I can't wait to get to the "New Chapter" in my work-life
